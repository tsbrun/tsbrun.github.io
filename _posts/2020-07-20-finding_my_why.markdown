I’m a self-proclaimed productivity-video-addict. 

Said videos often talk about the need to “know your why.” Understanding the reason why you’re doing something is related to intrinsic motivation. Instead of being motivated by extrinsic factors—the proverbial “carrot on a stick”—[studies have shown](http://https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/) that performance is improved when people are motivated by their own personal desire to accomplish something. 

Investing time, money, and mental energy into a coding bootcamp is no small decision. So, my enrollment in Flatiron School’s software engineering program logically begs the question—What’s *my* why?

It all started circa 2016, when I got my first taste of web development with Codecademy and freeCodeCamp.org. I remember the CSS lessons on freeCodeCamp, in particular. It was so exciting to learn terms like “the box model” and “class selectors”, to play around with the mini websites I coded with the TextEdit application on my laptop. Around the same time, I also discovered a wealth of free programming resources on the internet. I downloaded a pdf of the book “Automating the Boring Stuff with Python” and finished a couple of online data science lessons. And I created my very own Stack Overflow account. (To this day, I still haven’t posted a question of my own 🐔😅). 

During my sophomore year of high school, I took a two-semester CS course. For my final project, I built a Goodreads-esque website for one of my favorite book series at the time. It took me *at least* two hours to create a horizontal menu with internal links. With my limited knowledge of CSS and a color-picker tool I found online, I created an ombre background that matched the color scheme of the books’ cover art. I was so proud of that website (and still am, tbh). 

After that class was over, I continued my foray into web dev and discovered [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tv/noomQQ). Eventually, though, schoolwork picked up and coding turned into an infrequent hobby. However, I sustained my interest by reading programming blogs on Medium and watching Python tutorial videos on Youtube. 

Soon enough, it was time to make post-high school plans. I had always known I wanted to get into the tech industry. My dad is somewhat of a “tech junkie”, and I always grew up playing with the latest gadgets. He taught me a little about routers and switches, so I considered getting into IT and studying for a few CISCO certifications. I watched a few videos, read some study guides, set up a VM or two—but nothing really stuck. I could have sat down and forced myself to learn, but I just didn’t have a genuine interest in it. And, quite frankly, the whole networking thing was a bit intimidating. If you’ve ever seen the ICND-1 cert guide you’ll understand 😉. Let’s just say, the barrier for entry was quite high. 

Around January of this year, my dad sent me an email for Flatiron School. He had enrolled and was enthusiastic about the program, already spinning ideas of the amazing applications he would create. I decided to check it out for myself, so I applied and started on the free prep material. Immediately, I rediscovered the joy I experienced during those first Codecademy tutorials. 

What I love about programming is being able to see results from your code. With the Learn IDE, I could see progress when I wrote some lines of code and got a new error message or a test would pass. Building the Tic Tac Toe CLI was challenging, particularly when dealing with the arrays. But it was so rewarding to produce something with a function, a purpose—something I could interact with. 

I’ve inherited my father’s “addictive personality,” so—naturally—I was hooked.

Programming gives me the ability to be creative with a purpose. My imagination is no longer just in my head; I can actually turn my ideas into reality. Coding isn’t easy, nor would I want it to be; I like a good challenge. It’s not so much the end goal, but the process of encountering a roadblock, puzzling over possible solutions, and finally progressing to the next problem—the scientific method of programming, if you will—that motivates me.

Currently, my favorite languages are Ruby and Python, but I’m excited to get more proficient with JavaScript and other languages as I progress through the course. I’m also eager to tap into my running list of app ideas for upcoming projects. 

That’s my story—for now. We’ll see what’s to come 🙂. In the meantime, happy coding!
